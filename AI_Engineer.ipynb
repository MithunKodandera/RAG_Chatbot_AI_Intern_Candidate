It is useful to have one encompassing definition \\nthat is extensible as well as expressive, building on commonly understood concepts \\nfrom the past. For us, we refer to a few basic principles that embody an agent, and \\nwe use them to develop the notion of an “agent object” in the world of LLMs and \\nVLMs. We’ve distilled the following primary concepts that need to be embodied by an \\nagent object in order for them to be programmed scalably to build robust systems.\\n3. Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) \\nA common model used in agent-oriented programming (AOP) is the BDI model, \\nwhere agents are characterized by their beliefs (information about the world), \\ndesires (goals or objectives), and intentions (plans of action). \\nExample: The chatbot believes the user is seeking customer support, desires to \\nprovide the best assistance, and executes a plan to guide the user through relevant \\ntroubleshooting steps.\\n1. Autonomy \\nAn agent is an autonomous, interactive, goal-driven entity with its own state, \\nbehavior, and decision-making capabilities. It has the capability of \\nself-improvement when it sees that it is unable to meet the performance \\nparameters for reaching its goal. \\nExample: An Agentic Chatbot adapts its conversational tone and logic based on \\nuser feedback, refining responses to better align with the user's intent over time.\\n2. Reactivity and Proactivity \\nAgents can be both reactive, meaning they can sense their environment and \\nrespond to changes by taking actions, and proactive, meaning they can take \\ninitiative based on their goals. Agents can take actions that change the state of \\ntheir environment, which can ensure their progress toward their goal. \\nExample: The chatbot detects frustration in a user’s tone (reactivity) and proactively \\noffers a detailed guide or direct solution without waiting for further input.\\n15\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF library 17.00', 'creator': 'Adobe Illustrator 27.8 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2025-01-23T14:59:49+06:30', 'moddate': '2025-01-23T14:59:51+05:30', 'title': 'Ebook - Agentic AI Updated QR code', 'source': '/content/Ebook-Agentic-AI.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 21, 'page_label': '22'}, page_content='4. Social Ability & Communication \\nAgents have a communication mechanism and can interact with other agents or \\nentities in their environment. This interaction can be highly complex, as it may \\ninvolve negotiation, coordination, and cooperation. With the advent of LLMs, this \\ncommunication can be completely based on natural language, which is both \\nhuman - and machine - understandable. \\nExample: The chatbot interacts with a scheduling system to book appointments \\nand communicates the details in clear, natural language to the user.\\n 6. Memory \\nAn agent needs to have long-term memory (LTM) of its past interactions and \\nsuccessful past means of completing its task. LTM can help to greatly reduce the \\namount of computing that an agent must perform to complete a new task by \\nreferencing relevant past plans and actions. The memory is also the place where an \\nagent can store human demonstrations it has seen, which can expedite its \\nprogress without as rigorous a planning and reasoning loop. An agent also has \\nshort-term memory, which is typically its current context signified by prompts and \\nany information available in its context length. \\nExample: The chatbot recalls previous user preferences (LTM) to suggest relevant \\nsolutions and uses the current conversation’s context (STM) to address immediate \\nconcerns effectively. \\n 5. Constitution \\nAn agent needs to adhere to some regulations and policies depending on the \\nimperatives of its task and goals. It needs to protect itself from being \\ncompromised or destroyed as well as be trusted not to harm other agents sharing \\nthe environment in which it is operating. \\nExample: The chatbot complies with privacy regulations by anonymizing sensitive \\nuser data and ensures that it avoids generating harmful or biased responses. \\n16\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF library 17.00', 'creator': 'Adobe Illustrator 27.8 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2025-01-23T14:59:49+06:30', 'moddate': '2025-01-23T14:59:51+05:30', 'title': 'Ebook - Agentic AI Updated QR code', 'source': '/content/Ebook-Agentic-AI.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 22, 'page_label': '23'}, page_content='2.4 Categories and Types of Agentic Systems \\nAgentic AI systems can be understood through two main lenses: \\n              \\n4.1.

Social Ability & Communication \\nAgents have a communication mechanism and can interact with other agents or \\nentities in their environment.

Memory \\nAn agent needs to have long-term memory (LTM) of its past interactions and \\nsuccessful past means of completing its task. LTM can help to greatly reduce the \\namount of computing that an agent must perform to complete a new task by \\nreferencing relevant past plans and actions.

Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) \\nA common model used in agent-oriented programming (AOP) is the BDI model, \\nwhere agents are characterized by their beliefs (information about the world),', 'desires (goals or objectives), and intentions (plans of action). \\nExample: The chatbot believes the user is seeking customer support, desires to \\nprovide the best assistance, and executes a plan to guide the user through relevant \\ntroubleshooting steps.\\n1.

It has the capability of \\nself-improvement when it sees that it is unable to meet the performance', \"parameters for reaching its goal. \\nExample: An Agentic Chatbot adapts its conversational tone and logic based on \\nuser feedback, refining responses to better align with the user's intent over time.\\n2. Reactivity and Proactivity \\nAgents can be both reactive, meaning they can sense their environment and \\nrespond to changes by taking actions, and proactive, meaning they can take \\ninitiative based on their goals. Agents can take actions that change the state of\", 'their environment, which can ensure their progress toward their goal. \\nExample: The chatbot detects frustration in a user’s tone (reactivity) and proactively \\noffers a detailed guide or direct solution without waiting for further input.\\n15\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES', '4. Social Ability & Communication \\nAgents have a communication mechanism and can interact with other agents or \\nentities in their environment. This interaction can be highly complex, as it may \\ninvolve negotiation, coordination, and cooperation. With the advent of LLMs, this \\ncommunication can be completely based on natural language, which is both \\nhuman - and machine - understandable. \\nExample: The chatbot interacts with a scheduling system to book appointments', 'and communicates the details in clear, natural language to the user.\\n 6. Memory \\nAn agent needs to have long-term memory (LTM) of its past interactions and \\nsuccessful past means of completing its task.

Social Ability & Communication \\nAgents have a communication mechanism and can interact with other agents or \\nentities in their environment.

Memory \\nAn agent needs to have long-term memory (LTM) of its past interactions and \\nsuccessful past means of completing its task. LTM can help to greatly reduce the \\namount of computing that an agent must perform to complete a new task by \\nreferencing relevant past plans and actions.

The environment can be static or dynamic, and the agent \\ncan be reactive (responding to immediate stimuli) or proactive (planning for future \\noutcomes). The agent’s use of memory and learning from interactions enables \\ncontinuous improvement, leading to more effective and adaptive decision-making. \\nAs we progress, we will see how different decision-making models influence how \\nthese components work together. \\nEffectors\\nSensors\\nGoals: The desired outcomes \\ndriving the agent’s actions. \\nEnvironment: The \\nexternal world the agent \\ninteracts with. \\nAgent: The entity \\nperceiving and acting on \\nits environment.\\nActions: The decisions and \\nbehaviors taken to \\nachieve objectives. \\n14\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES', \"2.3 Defining Characteristics of an Agent \\nAgents have been defined in various ways and have been a point of discussion for \\nsome time now, especially after the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) \\nand Visual Language Models (VLM). It is useful to have one encompassing definition \\nthat is extensible as well as expressive, building on commonly understood concepts \\nfrom the past. For us, we refer to a few basic principles that embody an agent, and \\nwe use them to develop the notion of an “agent object” in the world of LLMs and \\nVLMs. We’ve distilled the following primary concepts that need to be embodied by an \\nagent object in order for them to be programmed scalably to build robust systems.\\n3. Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) \\nA common model used in agent-oriented programming (AOP) is the BDI model, \\nwhere agents are characterized by their beliefs (information about the world), \\ndesires (goals or objectives), and intentions (plans of action). \\nExample: The chatbot believes the user is seeking customer support, desires to \\nprovide the best assistance, and executes a plan to guide the user through relevant \\ntroubleshooting steps.\\n1. Autonomy \\nAn agent is an autonomous, interactive, goal-driven entity with its own state, \\nbehavior, and decision-making capabilities. It has the capability of \\nself-improvement when it sees that it is unable to meet the performance \\nparameters for reaching its goal. \\nExample: An Agentic Chatbot adapts its conversational tone and logic based on \\nuser feedback, refining responses to better align with the user's intent over time.\\n2. Reactivity and Proactivity \\nAgents can be both reactive, meaning they can sense their environment and \\nrespond to changes by taking actions, and proactive, meaning they can take \\ninitiative based on their goals. Agents can take actions that change the state of \\ntheir environment, which can ensure their progress toward their goal. \\nExample: The chatbot detects frustration in a user’s tone (reactivity) and proactively \\noffers a detailed guide or direct solution without waiting for further input.\\n15\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES\", '4. Social Ability & Communication \\nAgents have a communication mechanism and can interact with other agents or \\nentities in their environment. This interaction can be highly complex, as it may \\ninvolve negotiation, coordination, and cooperation. With the advent of LLMs, this \\ncommunication can be completely based on natural language, which is both \\nhuman - and machine - understandable. \\nExample: The chatbot interacts with a scheduling system to book appointments \\nand communicates the details in clear, natural language to the user.\\n 6. Memory \\nAn agent needs to have long-term memory (LTM) of its past interactions and \\nsuccessful past means of completing its task. LTM can help to greatly reduce the \\namount of computing that an agent must perform to complete a new task by \\nreferencing relevant past plans and actions. The memory is also the place where an \\nagent can store human demonstrations it has seen, which can expedite its \\nprogress without as rigorous a planning and reasoning loop.

Such architectures benefit from a single agent's ability \\nto operate without the risk of interference from other agents' feedback, which can be \\ndistracting. However, they may hit execution loops if their reasoning capabilities \\naren't robust.\\nIn contrast, MAS shines in tasks requiring diverse feedback and parallel task \\nexecution. These systems can leverage feedback from other agents to verify their \\nwork and improve task outcomes. \\nIn terms of asynchronous task execution, single-agent systems can conduct multiple \\nsimultaneous calls, but they lack inherent parallel execution capabilities, making them \\nslower in sequential planning and task execution. Multi-agent systems allow \\nindependent agent operation, facilitating dynamic task allocation and parallel \\nprocessing across multiple sub-goals derived from an overall goal. \\nIn all this, the role of human feedback is very important. Implementing iterative \\nfeedback mechanisms helps agents refine their solutions, correcting courses to \\nreach the desired goals more effectively. Human oversight further aligns agent \\nresponses with human expectations, thus reducing inefficient or invalid outputs for \\nhigh-risk tasks. \\nAgentic systems are also emerging that maintain overarching goals, and can sense \\nand react to their environments, and adjust their actions to progress toward these \\ngoals. MAS take these principles forward where the key idea is to orchestrate \\nmultiple autonomous atomic agents to get some tasks done. \\nDeveloping a single-agent system for automated quality control in \\nmanufacturing. This agent can independently inspect products on an assembly \\nline for defects using predefined parameters. But if the agent encounters \\nambiguous cases or lacks robust reasoning, it may fail to identify certain defects \\nor misclassify products. \\nEXAMPLE\\nA MAS for manufacturing could involve one agent inspecting products, another \\nmonitoring machinery performance, and a third optimizing production schedules. \\nCollaboration among agents ensures more accurate and efficient operations.\\nEXAMPLE\\nA MAS for smart manufacturing can simultaneously manage assembly, quality \\ncontrol, and inventory tracking. Each agent specializes in a task but works \\ncollectively to ensure smooth production flow. \\nEXAMPLE\\nIn a manufacturing setup, human feedback ensures that AI-driven quality \\ncontrol aligns with industry standards, minimizing the risk of faulty products \\nreaching the market. \\nEXAMPLE\\n24\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES\", \"Multi Agentic systems could be organized into hierarchical (where an agent operates \\nand communicates in a particular domain of influence) or peer-peer architecture \\n(where an agent can talk to any other agent) [Masterman].  \\nCommunication is a very important aspect of multi agent systems. Agents hearing all \\nthe communication between other agents can have its pros and cons. Sometimes \\nexcessive information from the communication chatter can interfere with the \\ndecision-making capacity of the agents, whereas too little information can also have \\nsimilar consequences.  \\nThere are some necessary components for a system to qualify as a multi-agent AI \\nsystem. A system is a multi-agent AI system when it contains all the foundational \\nagents mentioned in Section 2, and one or more worker and utility agents. It should \\nhave clear goals, and a communication mechanism for the agents to interact. \\n3.1 Structural Layers in Multi-Agent Systems\\nMAS are built upon a sophisticated architecture that consists of several \\ninterconnected layers, each playing a critical role in ensuring the system's autonomy \\nand intelligent interactions with its environment. The architecture is designed to \\nenable these systems to perform tasks independently, learn from their experiences, \\nand adapt over time. \\n  \\nPerception Layer: \\nAt the foundational level, the perception layer is tasked with data acquisition from the \\nenvironment. This layer comprises sensors and input devices that capture raw data, \\nwhich may include visual, auditory, or textual information, depending on the system's \\ndesign. The data is then preprocessed to extract meaningful features, filtering out \\nnoise and irrelevant details. This preprocessing stage often leverages techniques \\nfrom computer vision, natural language processing, or sensor fusion, ensuring that \\nsubsequent layers receive clean and actionable inputs. \\n  \\n   \\nRepresentation Layer: \\nThe perception layer feeds into the representation layer, which transforms the raw \\ninput into structured formats that are more manageable and efficient for the system \\nto process. This layer uses models to represent the world, entities, and potential \\nactions. Common representations include semantic networks, ontologies, and vector \\nspace models, which help the system interpret and organize sensory \\ninformation meaningfully. \\n25\\nAGENTIC AI FOR EXECUTIVES\", \"Decision-Making Layer: \\nAt the core of agentic systems is the decision-making layer. Here, the system \\nemploys sophisticated algorithms to analyze incoming data and representations to \\nmake informed decisions. This layer often incorporates elements of artificial \\nintelligence such as machine learning models, reinforcement learning, or rule-based \\nreasoning. The goal is to evaluate possible actions and select the most appropriate \\nstrategy based on the system's objectives and current environmental context. \\n  \\nPlanning Layer: \\nAugmenting the decision-making process, the planning layer devises strategies to \\nachieve complex goals over time. It involves predicting the outcomes of actions and \\nsequencing them to reach desired objectives efficiently. Techniques such as \\nheuristic-based search, optimization models, and probabilistic reasoning are often \\nused to construct robust and adaptable plans. \\nAction Layer: \\nThe action layer converts decisions into physical or digital actions, interacting with \\nexternal systems to produce results. Actuators or software routines handle these \\ntasks. Before execution, verification ensures actions align with intended decisions \\nand minimizes errors. \\n  \\nInteraction Layer: \\nTo facilitate seamless communication, the interaction layer manages dialogues and \\nexchanges between the AI system and humans or other systems.
